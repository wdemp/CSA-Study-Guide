Chapter 1: Defending Against Cybersecurity Threats

Domain 1 Threat Management: 
1.3: Given a network based threat implement, or recommend the appropriate response and countermeasures
1.4: Explain the purpose of practices used to secure a corporate environment

The CIA Triad(Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)
Confidentiality: "ensures the unauthorized individuals are not able to gain access to sensitive information"(pg.3 Chapple & Seidl 2017)
Confidentiality: ensures unauthorized individual are not able to gain access to sensitive information(pg.3 Chapple & Seidl 2017)


Integrity: "ensures that there are no unauthorized modifications to information or systems either intentionally or unintentionally." (pg.3 Chapple & Seidl 2017)

Availability: "ensures that information and systems to are ready to meet the needs of legitimate users at the time those users requewst them. Availability conrols are: fault tolerance, clustering, and backups, seeks to ensure that legitimate users may gain access as needed."  (pg.3 Chapple & Seidl 2017)
Evaluating Security Risks: Three important terms: vulnerabilities, Risks, Threats(pg.3 Chapple & Seidl 2017)

Vulnerability: "A weakness in a device, system, application, or process, that might allow an attack to take place."(pg.3 Chapple & Seidl 2017) "Vulnerabilities are internal factors that may be controlled by cybersecurity professionals."(pg.3 Chapple & Seidl 2017)' 
An example of an exploited vulnerability wouild be "A web server that is running an outdated version of the Apache service may contain a vulnerability that would allow an attacker to conduct a DoS attack against the websites hosted in that server, jeopardizing their availabiltiy (pg.3 Chapple & Seidl 2017)

Threat: "An outside source that may exploit a vulnerability" (pg.4 Chapple & Seidl 2017) This outside source is usually hackers , but in some cases this could be natural diaster related; such as floods, earthquakes, etc. There is obviously nothing a cybersecurity analyst can do about those, however mitigating any hardware/software/ human error will fall upon the Cybersecurity Analyst.
